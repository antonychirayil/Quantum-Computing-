quantum information processing  and eventually building a quantum processor 

(The Bloch Sphere
A fantastic feature of the two-level system is the ability to express the states as 
geometrical vectors on a sphere of radius 1, known as the Bloch sphere.)

first of all we need qubits and  quantum  systems like two level quantum systems 
and we need to control these qubits using single qubit control gates 
we need a lot of qubits to increase the processing capabilities, when using more qubits 
we need them to interact with each other so we use two qubit gates  
and lastly we need to readout the information processed from the qubits,
which are 0s and 1's  so we use qubit readout 

this has many challenges 
first we have to have gates which are super fast 
readout part should be super efficent with less error rate and more fidelity and should be 
strongly coupled to our qubits 
and the qubits should have long coherence i.e the 0's and 1's should be sharp and have stay for long time
