DANIEL SANK: Information is physical.
00:08
Written letters are carbon grains on paper.
00:11
Spoken words are vibrations of air molecules.
00:14
Computer bits are electric charge.
00:17
Each of these examples shares a common limitation--
00:20
they work under physics that was understood in the 1800s, known
00:24
as classical physics.
00:26
Science has progressed since then.
00:28
We've discovered a new set of laws called quantum mechanics.
00:32
Here's one of our chips designed to leverage
00:35
the rules of quantum mechanics to process information
00:37
in ways impossible on a computer based in classical physics.
00:42
You may have heard that quantum mechanics only
00:44
applies to microscopic objects, like atoms.
00:47
So how does this chip bring out quantum behavior?
00:50
I'm Daniel Sank, a research scientist working in the Google
00:53
AI Quantum Computing Lab.
00:55
In this video, we'll look at how our quantum
00:58
bits are made physically.
01:00
I want to explain the fundamental differences
01:02
between classical and quantum information
01:04
at the physical level so that you
01:06
can understand why our quantum bits are made how they are.
01:11
Physicists and computer scientists
01:13
both think in terms of states.
01:15
A physical state could be my position--
01:18
I can be on the left or on the right.
01:21
And physical laws determine how nature goes from one state
01:24
to another.
01:25
Observe.
01:26
If Sergio pushes me, my state changes.
01:32
A computer's state is the value of its memory bits
01:35
and computer programs determine how the computer goes
01:38
from one state to the next.
01:40
For example, when you hit the Play button,
01:43
YouTube's program started manipulating your computer's
01:45
memory to show this video.
01:48
Where physics has physical states and natural laws,
01:51
computer science has memory states and programs.
01:56
Think of the state of computer memory as a string of bits.
02:00
For end bits, there are two to the end possible strings.
02:04
But because we're based in classical physics,
02:06
the state of the computer is just one
02:09
of these states at each point in time.
02:12
On each step of a classical algorithm, we go from one state
02:16
to the next.
02:17
For example, the logic operation shown here
02:21
takes the state 0-0-0 to 1-1-0.
02:25
If we were to apply the same operation again,
02:28
we'd go from 1-1-0 to 0-1-0.
02:31
Compared to classical states, quantum states are more rich.
02:35
They can have weight in all possible classical states,
02:38
a situation physicists call superposition.
02:41
Each step of a quantum algorithm mixes the states
02:44
into complex superpositions.
02:46
For example, starting in 0-0-0, we
02:49
go to a superposition of 1-0-0, 1-0-1, and 1-1-1.
02:55
Then each of those three parts of the super post
02:57
state branches out to even more states.
03:01
The extra complexity of quantum computers
03:04
allows them to solve some problems
03:06
faster than a classical computer ever could.
03:09
We've discussed the computational difference
03:11
between classical and quantum, but how
03:13
do classical and quantum differ physically?
03:16
How do we bring out quantum mechanics
03:18
in our chip, which is so much bigger
03:20
than the tiny atoms in which quantum mechanics was
03:23
first discovered?
03:24
Let's take a detailed look at classical bits
03:27
at the physical level so that we can
03:29
understand the physical difference between classical
03:32
and quantum.
03:33
Classical computer bits are stored
03:35
in the presence or absence of charge
03:37
on a capacitor in a circuit called
03:39
dynamic RAM, or DRAM for short.
03:42
If there's charge, it's a logical 1,
03:44
and if there's no charge, it's a logical 0.
03:47
But there's more going on here.
03:48
Our logical 0 and 1 are actually made up
03:52
of the presence or absence of 300,000 electrons.
03:56
Why use so many?
03:57
In principle, we could just use the presence or absence of one
04:01
electron as our logical bid.
04:03
Well, physical bits are noisy.
04:06
Electrons are tiny and light, so they jiggle around and leak out
04:11
of the DRAM.
04:12
If we had only one electron and it were to leak out,
04:16
our bit would change value, which is an error.
04:19
By using lots of electrons, we're OK if a few leak out.
04:23
DRAM circuits periodically check the logical level
04:27
and replenish missing electrons.
04:30
Encoding one logical bit in the state of so many physical bits
04:35
gives classical information a level of reliability
04:38
that we take for granted.
04:40
We don't have to think about all those electrons bumping around
04:42
when we write our programs.
04:45
OK, so why can't we just put our DRAM
04:48
into a quantum superposition of 0 and 1?
04:51
Well, suppose we did have that superposition.
04:55
It wouldn't last long.
04:56
As soon as we do the first check to protect against a DRAM
05:00
error, we've forced the bit into either 0 or 1,
05:04
removing the quantum superposition state.
05:07
In fact, that collapse happens even
05:09
without us checking for errors.
05:12
A single photon interacting with just one of our electrons
05:16
can carry off information.
05:18
When that happens, it's as if the photon
05:21
observed the quantum state and the state collapses.
05:26
You can think of this as nature observing and thus destroying
05:30
our quantum states.
05:32
Errors like this are unique to quantum information.
05:36
In classical computing, you might be upset
05:39
if somebody peeks at your bits, but that peek doesn't
05:42
completely destroy them.
05:45
Note that an error occurs whenever nature observes
05:48
any one of our physical bits, so while we normally
05:52
stack up more physical bits for redundancy,
05:55
that approach actually makes quantum errors worse.
05:59
That's the main difficulty in quantum computation--
06:02
the fundamental quantum constituents of matter
06:05
are small and easily subjected to noise,
06:08
but we can't brute force our way around that noise
06:10
with redundancy because bigger systems are
06:13
more subject to quantum errors.
06:16
At Google, we use a technique that
06:18
gets the best of both worlds.
06:20
We use circuits with a huge number of electrons,
06:23
but we prevent quantum errors with superconductivity.
06:26
In regular metals, like with a conventional DRAM circuit,
06:30
every individual electron does its own thing.
06:33
As electrons move around, they can bounce off
06:36
the positively charged ions of the metal,
06:38
radiating vibrational waves that carry off quantum information
06:41
about the electrons.
06:43
This hectic, bustling cauldron of physical interactions
06:47
generates a lot of quantum errors,
06:49
and the information gets lost before we can use it.
06:53
However, when certain metals are cooled down,
06:56
their electrons join together in a single unit.
06:59
The individual electrons no longer scatter
07:02
and the rate of quantum errors drops to almost 0.
07:07
Our quantum bits are, in fact, just electoral oscillators
07:10
built from aluminum, which become
07:11
superconducting when cooled to below 1 degree Kelvin.
07:15
The oscillators store tiny amounts of electrical energy.
07:19
When the oscillator is in the 0 state, it has 0 energy.
07:23
When it's in the 1 state, it has a single quantum of energy.
07:27
The two states of the oscillator with 0 or 1 quantum of energy
07:32
are the logical states of our quantum bit,
07:34
or qubit for short.
07:36
Here's a picture of a superconducting qubit
07:39
along with a circuit diagram.
07:41
The crosses indicate Josephson tunnel junctions,
07:44
which are nonlinear superconducting inductors.
07:47
We pick the resonance frequency of our oscillators
07:49
to be about 6 gigahertz, which sets the energy difference
07:53
between the 0 and 1 states.
07:55
That's a low enough frequency that we
07:57
can build control electronics from readily available
08:00
commercial parts, but also high enough
08:03
that the ambient thermal energy doesn't
08:05
scramble the oscillation and introduce errors.
08:09
6 gigahertz corresponds to 300 millikelvin.
08:13
Fortunately, refrigerators that get to 15 millikelvin
08:17
are relatively standard commercial products.
08:19
For comparison, outer space is about 2.5 Kelvin.
08:25
I think it's cool that the cryostats in our lab
08:27
are colder than deep space.
08:30
Now let's take a minute to make a few comments on how
08:32
superconducting qubit architecture differs
08:35
from conventional computers.
08:38
In a conventional computer, memory and logic processing
08:42
are separated into the RAM and CPU.
08:46
When we want to do a computation,
08:47
we first move the data from the RAM to the CPU.
08:52
Then the circuits in the CPU do the computation,
08:55
and finally, the resulting data is written back to RAM.
08:59
In quantum computing, with superconducting qubits,
09:02
we can't afford the errors that would come
09:05
from moving the data around.
09:07
Instead, we build a grid of qubits, each one connected
09:11
to its neighbors.
09:12
The qubits stay put and we do logic operations
09:15
by sending control signals into individual qubits
09:19
or pairs of qubits.
09:22
Now that you have a basic picture of superconducting
09:24
qubits, let's take a look at one of the challenges
09:27
that we're still working on.
09:29
Superconductivity greatly reduces errors,
09:32
but there are still some.
09:34
For example, the electrons flowing in the oscillator
09:38
interact with charged particles in the surroundings,
09:40
leading to errors.
09:42
Suppose there were a charged ion inside the metal of our qubit.
09:46
The oscillating energy in the qubit
09:48
can transfer into that ion, causing the qubit's logic state
09:52
to flip, thus creating an error.
09:55
Improving the qubit fabrication process
09:58
to reduce these atomic imperfections
10:00
is a big part of our research.
10:02
Over the last several years, improvements
10:05
in microfabrication techniques have
10:06
decreased our qubit error rates a lot,
10:09
and we're still improving.
10:11
In this video, we focused on the idea
10:13
that information is physical.
10:15
We discussed the physical incarnation
10:17
of classical and quantum computer bits.
10:20
We introduced quantum errors and explained
10:22
why we need superconductivity to eliminate those errors.
10:26
If you'd like to know more, you can leave questions
10:29
in the comments section below.
10:30
It's important to me that you can understand
10:32
the physical aspects of quantum computation
10:34
as clearly as possible.
10:36
I'm also pretty active on Physics Stack Exchange.
10:39
You can find great questions and answers there, too.
