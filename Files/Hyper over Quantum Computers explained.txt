Quantum computers use the natural world to produce machines
00:04
with staggeringly powerful processing potential.
00:07
I think it's gonna be the most important computing
00:09
technology of this century, which we are really just about
00:13
one fifth into.
00:14
We could use quantum computers to simulate molecules, to
00:17
build new drugs and new materials and to solve problems
00:20
plaguing physicists for decades.
00:23
Wall Street could use them to optimize portfolios, simulate
00:26
economic forecasts and for complex risk analysis.
00:30
Quantum computing could also help scientists speed up
00:32
discoveries in adjacent fields like machine learning and
00:35
artificial intelligence.
00:37
Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft, plus a host of smaller
00:41
companies such as Rigetti and D-Wave, are all betting big
00:44
on Quantum. If you were a billionaire, how many of your
00:47
billion would you give over for an extra 10 years of life?
00:51
There are some simply astonishing financial opportunities
00:54
in quantum computing. This is why there's so much interest.
00:58
Even though it's so far down the road.
01:01
But nothing is ever a sure thing.
01:03
And dealing with the quirky nature of quantum physics
01:05
creates some big hurdles for this nascent technology.
01:08
From the very beginning, it was understood that building a
01:13
useful quantum computer was going to be a staggeringly hard
01:17
engineering problem if it was even possible at all.
01:20
And there were even distinguished physicists in the 90s who
01:24
said this will never work.
01:26
Is Quantum truly the next big thing in computing, or is it
01:29
destined to become something more like nuclear fusion?
01:32
Destined to always be the technology of the future, never
01:35
the present. In October 2019, Google made a big
01:42
announcement. Google said it had achieved quantum
01:46
supremacy. That's the moment when quantum computers can
01:49
beat out the world's most powerful supercomputers for
01:52
certain tasks.
01:53
They have demonstrated with a quantum computer that it can
01:57
perform a computation in seconds.
02:00
What would take the world's fastest supercomputer?
02:03
Years, thousands of years to do that same calculation.
02:08
And in the field, this is known as quantum supremacy and
02:10
it's a really important milestone.
02:12
Google used a 53 qubit processor named Sycamore to complete
02:16
the computation, a completely arbitrary mathematical
02:19
problem with no real world application.
02:22
The Google Quantum computer spit out an answer in about 200
02:25
seconds. It would have taken the world's fastest computer
02:29
around 10000 years to come up with a solution, according to
02:32
Google scientists.
02:33
With that, Google claimed it had won the race to quantum
02:36
supremacy. But IBM had an issue with the findings.
02:39
Yes, IBM, the storied tech company that helped usher in
02:43
giant mainframes and personal computing.
02:50
It's a major player in quantum computing.
02:55
IBM said one of its massive supercomputer networks, this
02:58
one at the Oak Ridge National Laboratories in Tennessee,
03:01
could simulate a quantum computer and theoretically solve
03:04
the same problem in a matter of days, not the 10000 years
03:07
that Google had claimed. Either way, it was a huge
03:10
milestone for quantum computers, and Silicon Valley is
03:14
taking notice. Venture capital investors are pouring
03:17
hundreds of millions of dollars into quantum computing
03:20
startups, even though practical applications are years or
03:23
even decades away by 2019.
03:26
Private investors have backed at least 52 quantum
03:28
technology companies around the world since 2012, according
03:32
to an analysis by nature.
03:34
Many of them were spun out of research teams at
03:37
universities in 2017 and 2018.
03:40
Companies received at least $450 million in private funding
03:44
more than four times the funding from the previous two
03:46
years. That's nowhere near the amount of funding going into
03:50
a field like artificial intelligence.
03:52
About $9.3
03:54
billion with a venture capital money poured into AI firms
03:56
in 2018. But the growth in quantum computing funding is
04:00
happening quickly for an industry without a real
04:02
application. Yet it is not easy to figure out how to
04:06
actually use a quantum computer to do something useful.
04:10
So nature gives you this very, very bizarre hammer in the
04:14
form of these this interference effect among all of these
04:17
amplitudes. Right.
04:19
And it's up to us as quantum computer scientists to figure
04:23
out what nails that hammer can hit.
04:26
That's leading to some backlash against the hype and
04:29
concern that quantum computing could soon become a bubble
04:31
and then dry up just as fast if progress stalls.
04:35
Quantum computers are also notoriously fickle.
04:37
They need tightly controlled environments to operate in.
04:40
Changes in nearby temperatures and electromagnetic waves
04:43
can cause them to mess up.
04:45
And then there's the temperature of the quantum chips
04:47
themselves. They need to be kept at temperatures colder
04:50
than interstellar space, close to absolute zero.
05:00
One of the central tenets of quantum physics is called
05:02
superposition. That means a subatomic particle like an
05:06
electron can exist in two different states at the same
05:09
time. It was and still is super hard for normal computers
05:13
to simulate quantum mechanics because of superposition.
05:17
No, it was only in the early eighties that a few
05:19
physicists, such as Richard Feynman had the amazing
05:23
suggestion that if nature is giving us that computational
05:28
lemon, well, why not make it into lemonade?
05:30
You've probably heard or read this explanation of how a
05:33
quantum computer works.
05:35
Regular or classical computers run on bits.
05:38
Bits can either be a 1 or a zero.
05:41
Quantum computers, on the other hand, run on quantum bits
05:44
or cubits. Cubits can be either 1 or zero or both or a
05:48
combination of the two at the same time.
05:51
That's not wrong per say, but it only scratches the
05:53
surface. According to Scott Aaronson, who teaches computer
05:56
science and quantum computing at the University of Texas in
05:59
Austin. We asked him to explain how quantum computing
06:02
actually works. Well, let me start with this.
06:05
You never hear your weather forecaster say we know there's
06:08
a negative 30 percent chance of rain tomorrow.
06:11
Right. That would just be non-sense, right?
06:13
Did the chance of something happening, as always, between 0
06:16
percent and 100 percent.
06:18
But now quantum mechanics is based on numbers called
06:22
amplitudes. Amplitudes can be positive or negative.
06:27
In fact, they can even be complex numbers involving the
06:30
square root of negative one.
06:32
So so a qubit is a bit that has an amplitude for being zero
06:37
and another amplitude for being one.
06:40
The goal for quantum computers is to make sure the
06:42
amplitudes leading to wrong answers cancel each other out.
06:46
And it scientists reading the output of the quantum
06:48
computers are left with amplitudes leading to the right
06:51
answer of whatever problem they're trying to solve.
06:53
So what does a quantum computer look like in the real
06:56
world? The quantum computers developed by companies such as
06:59
Google, IBM and Rigetti were all made using a process
07:02
called superconducting
07:04
And this is where you have a chip the size of an ordinary
07:08
computer chip and you have little coils of wire in the
07:13
chip, you know, which are actually quite enormous by the
07:16
standards of cubits.
07:17
There are, you know, nearly big enough to see with the
07:19
naked eye. But you can have two different quantum states of
07:24
current that are flowing through these coils that
07:27
correspond to a zero or a one.
07:30
And of course, you can also have super positions of the
07:33
two. Now the coil can interact with each other via
07:37
something called Josef's injunctions.
07:39
So they're laid out in roughly a rectangular array and the
07:43
nearby ones can talk to each other and thereby generate
07:48
these very complicated states, what we call entangled
07:50
states, which is one of the essentials of quantum computing
07:55
and the way that the cubists interact with each other is
07:58
fully programmable.
07:59
OK. So you can send electrical signals to the chip to say
08:04
which cube it should interact with each other ones at which
08:07
time. Now the order for this to work, the whole chip is
08:12
placed in that evolution refrigerator.
08:14
That's the size of a closet roughly.
08:17
And the calls it do about one hundredth of a degree above
08:19
absolute zero. That's where you get the superconductivity
08:22
that allows these bits to briefly behave as cubits.
08:32
And IBM's research lab in Yorktown Heights, New York, the
08:35
big tech company, houses several quantum computers already
08:38
hooked up to the cloud. Corporate clients such as Goldman
08:41
Sachs and JP Morgan are part of IBM's Q Network, where they
08:45
can experiment with the quantum machines and their
08:47
programming language.
08:49
So far, it's a way for companies to get used to quantum
08:51
computing rather than make money from it.
08:53
Quantum computers need exponentially more cubits before
08:56
they start doing anything useful.
08:58
IBM recently unveiled a fifty three cubic computer the same
09:01
size as Google's sycamore processor.
09:03
We think we're actually going to need tens of thousands,
09:07
hundreds of thousands of qubits to get to real business
09:10
problems. So you can see quite a lot of advances and
09:13
doubling every year or perhaps even a little faster is what
09:16
we need to get us there. That's why it's 10 years out, at
09:19
least.
09:21
Quantum computing would need to see some big advances
09:22
between then and now, bigger advances than what occurred
09:25
during the timeline of classical computing and Moore's Law.
09:29
Oh, we need better than Moore's Law.
09:30
Moore's Law is doubling every two years.
09:32
We're talking doubling every year.
09:34
And occasionally some really big jumps.
09:36
So what's quantum computers become useful?
09:38
What can they do? Scientists first came up with the idea
09:41
for quantum computers as a way to better simulate quantum
09:44
mechanics. That's still the main purpose for them.
09:47
And it also holds the most moneymaking potential.
09:49
So one example is the caffeine molecule.
09:53
Now, if you're like me, you've probably ingested billions
09:58
or trillions of. Caffeine molecules so far today.
10:01
Now, if computers are really that good, really that
10:05
powerful. We have these these tremendous supercomputers
10:08
that are out there. We should be able to really take a
10:11
molecule and represented exactly in a computer.
10:15
And this would be great for many fields, health care,
10:18
pharmaceuticals, creating new materials, creating new
10:21
flavorings anywhere where molecules are in play.
10:25
So if we just start with this basic idea of caffeine, it
10:28
turns out it's absolutely impossible to represent one
10:32
simple little caffeine molecule in a classical computer
10:36
because the amount of information you would need to
10:39
represent it, the number of zeros and ones you would need
10:43
is around ten to forty eight.
10:46
Now, that's a big number. That's one with forty eight zeros
10:49
following it. The number of atoms in the earth are about 10
10:55
to 100 times that number.
10:57
So in the worst case, one caffeine molecule could use 10
11:02
percent of all the atoms in the earth just for storage.
11:06
That's never going to happen.
11:08
However, if we have a quantum computer with one hundred and
11:11
sixty cubits and this is a model of a 50 kubert machine
11:15
behind me, you can kind of figure, well, if we make good
11:18
progress, eventually we'll get up to 160 good cubits.
11:23
It looks like we'll be able to do something with caffeine,
11:27
a quantum computer, and it's never going to be possible.
11:30
Classical computer and other potential use comes from Wall
11:33
Street. Complex risk analysis and economic forecasting.
11:37
Quantum computing also has big potential for portfolio
11:39
optimization. Perhaps the biggest business opportunity out
11:43
of quantum computing in the short term is simply preparing
11:45
for the widespread use of them.
11:47
Companies and governments are already attempting to quantum
11:50
proof their most sensitive data and secrets.
11:53
In 1994, a scientist at Bell Labs named Peter Shaw came up
11:57
with an algorithm that proved quantum computers could
12:00
factor huge numbers much more quickly than their classical
12:03
counterparts. That also means quantum computers is powerful
12:06
and efficient enough could theoretically break RSA
12:09
encryption. RSA is the type of encryption that underpins
12:12
the entire internet.
12:14
Quantum computers, the way they're built now, would need
12:16
millions of cubits to crack RSA cryptography.
12:19
But that milestone could be 20 or 30 years away and
12:22
governments and companies are beginning to get ready for
12:25
it. For a lot of people, that doesn't matter.
12:27
But for example, for health records, if health records to
12:30
be opened up that could compromise all kinds of things.
12:32
Government communications. Banking records.
12:34
Sometimes even banking records from decades ago contain
12:36
important information that you don't want exposed.
12:40
But the problem we've got is we don't really know when
12:43
we'll be able to do this or even if we'll ever build one
12:46
big enough to do this.
12:48
But what we do now, is that if you don't update your
12:50
cryptography now, all the messages you send over the next
12:53
few years and the ones in history could potentially be
12:57
read. What this means, for example, is if you're a Cisco
13:02
selling networking equipment, you're going to offer
13:04
quantum-safe encryption as an option in the very near
13:08
future. Becayse even though it doesn't look like you need
13:10
it right away. If your product doesn't have it and a
13:13
competitor does, guess which product gets bought?
13:23
One big issue facing quantum computing, other than
13:25
increasing the number of cubits while keeping things
13:27
stable, is that no one actually knows the best way to build
13:30
a quantum computer. Yet the Quantum computers, a Google of
13:33
IBM and other companies show off are very much still
13:37
experiments. There's also a big education gap.
13:40
Not many people are studying quantum computing yet.
13:42
China is pouring billions into quantum computing education,
13:46
and the U.S. Congress passed a law in 2018 called the
13:48
National Quantum Initiative Act in order to help catch up
13:52
watching people get rid of him.
13:56
Which means that you want to invest in them now.
13:58
You want to be hiring people with quantum computing
14:00
knowledge. Not necessarily to do quantum computing, but
14:03
because you want that intelligence in your organisation so
14:07
you can take advantage of it when it shows up.
14:10
Now China, with its promised $10 billion in it, is really
14:13
upping stakes in terms of the number of Chinese quantum
14:16
physics PhDs that are going to start appearing.
14:19
And you know if that hair restoration or life extension
14:22
drug happens to be property of the Chinese government, what
14:25
does that do to the world economy?
14:27
That's much more powerful than making war Other experts
14:34
have compared Google's announcement to Sputnik, the Soviet
14:37
satellite launched into orbit in 1957.
14:40
The beach ball sized satellite was the first manmade object
14:43
to orbit the Earth. But Sputnik didn't really do anything
14:47
useful other than prove launching something into space was
14:50
possible. Many people are surprised that where exactly we
14:56
are. For those who are just getting started, they like to
15:00
make noise about vacuum tubes and Sputnik and things like
15:04
this. But let me give you some numbers.
15:08
IBM has had quantum computers on the cloud for three and a
15:11
half years since May of 2016.
15:15
We're not in any sort of Sputnik error.
15:18
We're not landing on the moon.
15:21
But for those of you who like space history, I think we're
15:23
probably well into Mercury or Gemini.
