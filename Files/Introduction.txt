Quantum computers are completely new and an entirely different kind of computer quantum mechanics refers to the behavior of the most basic parts of our world the
fundamental elementary particles that make up the universe these elementary
particles do not act in the same way the world around us does they have totally
different properties sometimes the particles can react in totally
unpredictable ways even popping in and out of existence if we take these
properties out of the quantum world and enlarge them to work in our classical
world we can take advantage of them. 

conventional computers work through transistors a transistor can be in two different states on or off 1 or 0 these numbers are known as binary digits or bits these transistors react from input the output goes through logic gates until the final result is outputted and
you see what's on your screen

quantum computers work by taking the properties of quantum mechanics and applying them
to computers instead of using a transistor to compute data quantum computers use quantum objects as a special kind of transistor known as a quantum binary digit or qubit the
quantum object use can be a number of different fundamental particles the only
requirement is that the quantum object
behaves in the laws of quantum mechanics
this is the reason why quantum computers
are so different compared to classical
computers it competes using the special
and strange properties of the quantum
world the first strange property of
quantum mechanics is superposition
superposition is a very odd quantum
phenomenon in which an object is in more
than one state at once 

if you flip the

coin there are two possible outcomes

heads or tails before the coin lands we

don't know if it's going to be head

details so simply in the quantum world

it would be both once it lands and we

observe it it will be one of the other

but before that it is in multiple states

a superposition

quantum objects behave in almost the

same way as a flipped coin one of the

fundamental particles that can be used

as a qubit is an electron one of the

properties of an electron is their spin

the electron isn't really spinning but

rather describes its rotation along a

magnetic field think of an electron like

a compass needle the compass will always

point north but if you were to turn 

exactly  degrees it would stay like

that electrons behave in a similar way

electrons always point in the direction

of the magnetic field that is the

sitting position or spin down but if you

were to turn it exactly  degrees it

would have a spin up this property can

be used as a qubit because it can be in

a superposition the difference between

coins compasses and electrons is coins

and compasses aren't quantum objects and

they don't behave in a true quantum way

real quantum objects changes we observe

them the outcome changes because they're

forced to make a decision before we

measure an electron in a superposition

it hasn't decided whether it's up or

down it has a certain percentage of

being both but because we can't measure

something that's in a superposition we

won't know what that percentage is it's

like if you had a coin flat on a table

and when you look at it it decided

whether it's heads or tails

 the real

purpose of quantum computers comes in

the increase in computing power with one

regular bit we have two possible states

 or  when we have two regular bits

there are four possible states     

 and   the computer only outputs one

of those variants when we have two

qubits they're the same possible state

but with super positions each qubit can

be in a combination of both the  and 

state this causes quantum computers to

be much more powerful than classical

computers this means only  bits a

classical computer will output  bits of

information with two qubits because they

can simultaneously be in the  and 

state it will contain  bits of

information

therefore when more qubits are added it

will output to ^ number of qubits bits

of information because of the power of

Exponential's this means even a simple

quantum computer can be more powerful

than our current supercomputers but

there's a big problem using super

positions in computing while qubits can

compute data in multiple states at once

only one of those states can be observed

this means that a quantum computer can

compute many different things at once

but only one of those things can be

outputted this means the computer will

choose the best variant output what

superposition allows us to do is have a

qubit in multiple states at once so

you're doing computation of kicking a

soccer ball into a net let's say the

only variable is the Y position on the

ball and it can be  in centimeters to

 centimeters with a regular computer

we would have to do one computation at 

centimeters then you another at 

centimeter and so on one at a time we

would have to try the algorithm with

every possible position the ball could

be in with a quantum computer the qubits

could exist in every position from  to

 and then once the quantum computer

finds a position where the ball would

make it into the net you would output

the position of the ball a quantum

computer can have qubits that exist in

every possible state and then they can

output the best answer superposition is

only one of the many strange properties

of quantum mechanics one of the more

bizarre parts the quantum world is

entanglement entanglement is a property

where two particles they have exactly

the opposite if two particles are

entangled and one it's changed in some

way the other will react the exact

opposite way this action of being

different than the other particle is

done instantly faster than anything else

in the world even like it gets even more

amazing when you observe the distance

that particles can be entangled two

particles could be on opposite ends of

the universe and still become opposite

instantly

this property is so strange Einstein

described it as spooky motion at a

distance because he couldn't figure out

how it worked and even denied it existed

it is really spooky objects in our

everyday life don't follow these rules

an apple doesn't flip upside down

because it doesn't want to be like

another Apple entanglement can be

thought of like two coins in

superpositions if the two coins are

spinning and the first one lands on

heads you instantly know the second one

is going to be tails

even if you don't look at it the problem

with quantum computing lies in

engineering one quantum computing is all

about taking the microscopic world and

getting it to control our macroscopic

world the microscopic world is very

finicky this hard to control and it is

almost impossible to predict but if we

can harness power the quantum world

quantum computers will truly change the

future allowing us to do things that

would never be possible with classical

computers the strange properties of

these specialty computers will open up a

whole new world of computing quantum

computers are very subtle and very

complex machines and we still have a lot

to learn about them
