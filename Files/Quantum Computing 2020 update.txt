00:34
with a brief summary of what quantum
00:36
computing
00:37
is all about
00:43
the microprocessors in conventional or
00:46
classical computers are built from
00:48
billions of transistors that are turned
00:50
on
00:50
or off to represent a value of either
00:52
one or
00:53
zero in turn this allows classical
00:56
computers to store
00:58
and process data using binary digits or
01:00
bits
01:02
in contrast quantum computers process
01:05
information
01:06
using quantum bits or qubits
01:09
these can be created in many different
01:11
ways
01:12
for example using superconducting
01:14
electronic circuits
01:15
or by trapping ionized atoms as i'll
01:18
discuss later
01:18
in the video unlike
01:22
classical bits qubits can exist in more
01:24
than one state
01:25
or superposition at exactly the same
01:28
point in time
01:29
this allows a qubit to assume a value of
01:32
one
01:32
or zero or both of these numbers
01:35
simultaneously
01:36
in turn this potentially enables a
01:38
quantum computer
01:40
to process a far higher number of data
01:41
possibilities than a classical computer
01:44
indeed in theory quantum computers will
01:47
be able to accomplish
01:48
tasks which are impossible to perform
01:50
using conventional hardware
01:58
today quantum computing remains in the
02:00
research
02:01
phase with all quantum hardware created
02:04
for experimental purposes
02:06
this said many traditional computing
02:08
companies are now developing
02:10
and operating quantum computers with key
02:12
players
02:13
including ibm google alibaba
02:16
microsoft intel and honeywell
02:20
there are also a whole host of pure play
02:22
hardware and software startups
02:24
including one qubit cqc
02:27
d-wave systems inq qc
02:30
ware q-simulate quantum circuits
02:33
rocco rigetti zenodu and zapata
02:37
you can find out more about what these
02:39
companies are doing on the quantum
02:40
computing page
02:41
on explainingcomputers.com
02:46
quantum computers will only become a
02:48
viable commercial technology when they
02:50
can perform useful calculations that
02:52
cannot be executed
02:53
on a classical computer back in 2012
02:57
professor john preskill coins the term
02:59
quantum supremacy to define this concept
03:02
writing that in the era of quantum
03:04
supremacy we will be able to perform
03:06
tasks with controlled quantum systems
03:08
going beyond what can be achieved with
03:10
ordinary digital computers
03:14
in october 2019 google claimed to have
03:17
achieved
03:18
quantum supremacy as it reported a team
03:21
of google scientists had used a quantum
03:23
processor called sycamore
03:25
to sample the output of a pseudo-random
03:27
quantum circuit
03:29
sycamore took about 200 seconds to
03:31
sample one
03:32
instance of the circuit a million times
03:35
in comparison the google team estimated
03:38
that a classical supercomputer would
03:40
take about 10 000 years
03:42
to perform the same calculations as the
03:44
team went on to conclude
03:46
quantum processors based on
03:47
superconducting qubits
03:49
can now perform computations beyond the
03:51
reach of the fastest classical
03:53
supercomputers available today
03:55
to our knowledge this experiment marks
03:57
the first computation
03:58
that can be performed only on a quantum
04:01
processor
04:02
quantum processors have thus reached the
04:04
regime of quantum supremacy
04:08
the google announcement was big news but
04:11
soon controversial
04:12
not least ibm published a blog post in
04:15
which they stated that the computations
04:17
in google's experiment
04:18
could be undertaken on a classical
04:20
computer in two and a half
04:21
days rather than ten thousand years
04:24
as ibm went on to contend because the
04:27
original meaning of the term quantum
04:29
supremacy
04:30
as proposed by john prescott in 2012 was
04:33
to describe the point where quantum
04:34
computers
04:35
can do things that classical computers
04:37
can't this threshold has not been met
04:42
ibm and google are rivals who have
04:44
created quantum computers
04:46
based on the same kind of
04:47
superconducting josephson junction
04:49
qubits it's therefore perhaps not
04:51
surprising that ibm disputed
04:54
google's achievement however and more
04:57
broadly
04:57
ibm and some other quantum computing
05:00
specialists
05:01
increasingly question the importance of
05:03
the quantum supremacy concept
05:05
not least they are concerned that future
05:08
experiments which demonstrate quantum
05:09
supremacy
05:10
may involve tasks with no useful or
05:13
commercial application
05:20
whilst the quantum supremacy debate has
05:22
raged the last 12
05:24
months have seen a notable expansion of
05:26
cloud-based quantum computing
05:28
or quantum computing as a service
05:31
the birth of qcaas dates back to may
05:34
2016
05:35
when ibm launched the ibmq experience
05:38
to make a quantum computer available
05:40
over the internet
05:42
just under two years later chinese
05:44
e-commerce giant alibaba
05:46
followed suit with its superconducting
05:48
quantum computing
05:49
cloud this was developed with the
05:52
chinese academy of sciences
05:54
and like ibm q allows users to run
05:57
quantum programs in the cloud
05:58
and download the results
06:01
in october 2018 canadian quantum
06:04
computing pioneer d-wave systems
06:06
also made available a service called
06:08
leap to provide cloud access to its
06:10
quantum computing hardware
06:12
and in january 2019 rival quantum
06:16
computing pureplay riggetti
06:17
launched its quantum cloud services or
06:19
qcs platform
06:23
the big quantum cloud news of the past
06:25
12 months
06:26
has been the entry of amazon and
06:28
microsoft as new market players
06:31
amazon's qc ais offerings were announced
06:34
on december
06:35
2nd 2019 and include an aws solution
06:39
called amazon bracket that allows
06:41
scientists researchers and developers to
06:43
begin experimenting with quantum
06:44
computers from multiple hardware
06:46
providers
06:47
specifically customers can access
06:49
hardware from d-wave systems
06:52
iron q and righty which means they can
06:55
experiment with quantum computers based
06:57
on three different
06:58
qubit technologies
07:01
in addition to bracket amazon also
07:03
launched the amazon quantum solutions
07:06
lab
07:07
this is intended to help companies to
07:09
get ready for quantum computing by
07:11
allowing them to work with leading
07:13
pioneers
07:14
so a key thing that amazon is doing with
07:17
its quantum computing offerings
07:19
is to act as a broker in the cloud
07:23
on may 19 2020 microsoft entered the
07:26
fray
07:27
when it announced azure quantum whilst
07:30
microsoft is working with several
07:31
universities to develop its own quantum
07:34
hardware
07:34
for its current cloud offering it's
07:36
adopted the same strategy as
07:38
amazon to partner with those who already
07:40
have quantum hardware and software
07:42
solutions available this allows
07:44
microsoft to offer its azure quantum
07:46
stack
07:47
which it describes as an open cloud
07:49
ecosystem
07:50
offering access to a diverse set of
07:53
quantum resources
07:54
including pre-built solutions quantum
07:56
development tools such as simulators and
07:58
resource estimation
08:00
tools accelerated classical hardware and
08:02
a variety
08:03
of quantum hardware
08:11
one of the developments that's most
08:13
captured my own attention in the past 12
08:15
months
08:15
has been progress in trapped iron
08:18
quantum computing
08:20
key players here include the university
08:22
of oxford as well as a company called
08:24
iron
08:24
q but in october 2019 secured 55 million
08:28
dollars of
08:29
funding the technology page of the inq
08:32
website
08:33
explains what trapped iron quantum
08:35
computing is all about
08:36
and really is an excellent learning
08:38
resource
08:40
in simple terms trapped iron quantum
08:43
computing
08:44
creates each qubit by removing an
08:45
electron from an atom
08:47
in order to turn it into an ion with a
08:49
positive electrical charge
08:52
a chip known as a linear ion trap is
08:55
then used to hold chains of ion qubits
08:57
in 3d space where they can be
08:59
manipulated and read
09:01
using lasers all of this is extremely
09:04
difficult to achieve and control
09:06
not least because the qubits need to be
09:08
super cooled to almost absolute zero
09:10
as well as being isolated in a very high
09:13
quality
09:14
vacuum chamber
09:17
in addition to iron q another key player
09:20
is
09:20
honeywell who in june 2020 announced
09:23
that it had used trapped iron technology
09:25
to create the world's highest
09:26
performance quantum computer
09:29
clearly others may take a different view
09:32
but
09:33
regardless this is another important
09:35
development particularly
09:36
as honeywell reports that jpmorgan chase
09:40
is already experimenting with its system
09:42
to develop quantum financial services
09:44
software
09:45
including fraud detection and ai trading
09:48
applications
09:54
always when i make a video about quantum
09:57
computing
09:58
i get questions about how quantum
10:00
computers are programmed
10:02
at present this takes place using a
10:04
classical computer as a control device
10:06
with the languages used including python
10:10
an explanation of exactly what is
10:12
involved is well beyond the scope of
10:14
this video
10:15
but if you want to learn more and
10:17
actually experiment
10:18
go to the ibm quantum computing website
10:21
and click on
10:22
for developers next select try kiskit
10:25
which will allow you to experiment with
10:27
this open source development
10:30
environment one great
10:33
but still quite complex example shows
10:35
how it is possible to estimate the value
10:37
of pi
10:38
using a quantum phase estimation
10:40
algorithm
10:41
as you can see the python code begins by
10:44
importing relevant libraries
10:46
before progressing using commands that
10:48
will be pretty familiar to those with
10:50
some programming background
10:52
absolutely this is complex and something
10:54
you need to get your head around
10:57
but what i hope it makes clear is that
10:59
quantum computing is not quite so
11:01
removed from traditional computing as
11:03
many people believe
11:10
quantum computing is yet to become a
11:13
commercial
11:14
reality this said as we've seen in this
11:17
video
11:17
significant progress continues to be
11:20
made and
11:21
i remain confident that some kind of
11:23
quantum hardware will find useful
11:25
application
11:26
in the second half of this decade
11:30
