00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,920
welcome to another video from explaining

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,920



5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,920
computers

00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:17,990



7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,920
this time it's my fourth annual update

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,920



9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,199
on the state of play

10
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,199



11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,119
in quantum computing this video

12
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:27,119



13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,439
is mainly going to focus on what the

14
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:29,439



15
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,120
pioneers in the area have been achieving

16
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,120



17
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,399
in the past 12 months however as usual i

18
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,399



19
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,480
thought we should start out

20
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:36,480



21
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,440
with a brief summary of what quantum

22
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,440



23
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,399
computing

24
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,399



25
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,399
is all about

26
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:43,670



27
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,239
the microprocessors in conventional or

28
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:48,239



29
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,320
classical computers are built from

30
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:50,320



31
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,640
billions of transistors that are turned

32
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,640



33
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,960
on

34
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,960



35
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,840
or off to represent a value of either

36
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,840



37
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,960
one or

38
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,960



39
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,000
zero in turn this allows classical

40
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,000



41
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,960
computers to store

42
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,960



43
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,719
and process data using binary digits or

44
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,719



45
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,360
bits

46
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:05,360



47
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,159
in contrast quantum computers process

48
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,159



49
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,200
information

50
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:09,200



51
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,600
using quantum bits or qubits

52
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,600



53
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,320
these can be created in many different

54
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:12,320



55
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,320
ways

56
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,320



57
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,600
for example using superconducting

58
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,600



59
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,000
electronic circuits

60
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,000



61
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,960
or by trapping ionized atoms as i'll

62
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,960



63
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,159
discuss later

64
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,159



65
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,720
in the video unlike

66
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,720



67
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,759
classical bits qubits can exist in more

68
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,759



69
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,000
than one state

70
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:28,000



71
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,520
or superposition at exactly the same

72
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,520



73
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,240
point in time

74
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,240



75
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,880
this allows a qubit to assume a value of

76
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,880



77
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,000
one

78
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,000



79
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,720
or zero or both of these numbers

80
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,720



81
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,880
simultaneously

82
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,880



83
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,000
in turn this potentially enables a

84
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,000



85
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,840
quantum computer

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,840



87
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,640
to process a far higher number of data

88
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,640



89
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,040
possibilities than a classical computer

90
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,040



91
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,159
indeed in theory quantum computers will

92
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,159



93
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,479
be able to accomplish

94
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,479



95
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:55,840
tasks which are impossible to perform

96
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:55,840



97
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,840
using conventional hardware

98
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,310



99
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,680
today quantum computing remains in the

100
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,680



101
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,240

105
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,720
for experimental purposes

106

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,920
quantum supremacy as it reported a team

169
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,440
of google scientists had used a quantum

177
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,480
sycamore took about 200 seconds to

183
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,000
in comparison the google team estimated

184
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,000



185
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,000
that a classical supercomputer would

186
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,000



187
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,720
take about 10 000 years

188
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,720



189
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,239
to perform the same calculations as the

190
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,239



191
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,760
team went on to conclude

192
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:47,760



193
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,280
quantum processors based on

197
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,120
can now perform computations beyond the

198
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:53,120



199
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,599
reach of the fastest classical

201
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,599
supercomputers available today

202

203
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,959
to our knowledge this experiment marks

204
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:58,959



205
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,360
the first computation

206
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:01,360



207
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,319
that can be performed only on a quantum

208
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,319

211
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:08,480
quantum processors have thus reached the

212
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,480



213
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,040

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,959
the google announcement was big news but

216
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,959



217
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,599
soon controversial

218
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:15,599



219
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,359
not least ibm published a blog post in

220
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,359



221
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,639
which they stated that the computations

222
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:18,639



223
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,160
in google's experiment

224
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:20,160



225
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,759
could be undertaken on a classical

00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,759



227
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,880
computer in two and a half

00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:24,880



229
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,360
days rather than ten thousand years

230
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,360



231
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,040
as ibm went on to contend because the

232
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,040



233
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,080
original meaning of the term quantum

234
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,080



235
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,040
supremacy

236
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,040



237
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,800
as proposed by john prescott in 2012 was

238
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,800



239
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,520
to describe the point where quantum

240
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,520



241
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,600
computers

242
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,600



243
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,320
can do things that classical computers

244
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:42,320



245
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:44,639
can't this threshold has not been met

246
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,639



247
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,160
ibm and google are rivals who have

248
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:46,160



249
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,440
created quantum computers

250
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,440



251
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,680
based on the same kind of

252
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,680



253
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,840
superconducting josephson junction

255
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,000
qubits it's therefore perhaps not

256
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,000



257
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,040
surprising that ibm disputed

258
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,040



259
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,840
google's achievement however and more

263
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,199
ibm and some other quantum computing

267
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,600
increasingly question the importance of

268
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,600



269
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,080
the quantum supremacy concept

270
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,080



271
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,919
not least they are concerned that future

272
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,919



273
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,880
experiments which demonstrate quantum

00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:10,880



275
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,120

281
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,080
whilst the quantum supremacy debate has

282
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,080



283
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,320
raged the last 12

285
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,080

289
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,440
or quantum computing as a service

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,440



291
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,600
the birth of qcaas dates back to may

295
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,960
when ibm launched the ibmq experience

297
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,800
to make a quantum computer available

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,080
specifically customers can access

362
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,080



363
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,440
hardware from d-wave systems

373
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,240
in addition to bracket amazon also

374
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:06,240



375
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,440
launched the amazon quantum solutions

376
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,440

379
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,599
this is intended to help companies to

380
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:11,599



381
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,360
get ready for quantum computing by

387
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,039
so a key thing that amazon is doing with

388
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:19,039



389
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:23,120

00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:56,720



427
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,800
including pre-built solutions quantum

428
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,800



429
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,000
development tools such as simulators and

430
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,000



431
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,960
resource estimation

432
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,960



433
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,840
tools accelerated classical hardware and

434
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,840



435
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,120
a variety

436
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,120



437
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,120
of quantum hardware

438
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,510



439
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,199
one of the developments that's most

440
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:15,199



441
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,759
captured my own attention in the past 12

442
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:15,759



443
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,080
months

444
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:18,080



445
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,000
has been progress in trapped iron

446
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,000



447
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,160
quantum computing

448
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,160



449
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,240
key players here include the university

450
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,240



451
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,800
of oxford as well as a company called

452
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,800



453
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,639
iron

454
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,639



455
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,280
q but in october 2019 secured 55 million

456
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:29,280



457
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,479
dollars of

458
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,479



459
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,279
funding the technology page of the inq

460
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:33,279



461
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,039
website

462
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:35,039



463
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,719
explains what trapped iron quantum

464
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:36,719



465
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,880
computing is all about

466
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:38,880



467
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,959
and really is an excellent learning

468
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,959



469
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,200
resource

470
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:43,200



471
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,000
in simple terms trapped iron quantum

472
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,000



473
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,839
computing

474
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,839



475
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,279
creates each qubit by removing an

476
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:47,279



477
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,680
electron from an atom

478
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:49,680



479
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,080
in order to turn it into an ion with a

480
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,080



481
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,040
positive electrical charge

482
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,040



483
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,519
a chip known as a linear ion trap is

484
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,519



485
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,519
then used to hold chains of ion qubits

486
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:59,519



487
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,200
in 3d space where they can be

488
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:01,200



489
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,480
manipulated and read

490
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,480



491
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,399
using lasers all of this is extremely

492
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,399



493
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,160
difficult to achieve and control

494
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:08,160



495
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,800
not least because the qubits need to be

496
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,800



497
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,360
super cooled to almost absolute zero

498
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,360



499
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,000
as well as being isolated in a very high

500
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,000



501
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,040
quality

502
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,040



503
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,040
vacuum chamber

504
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,350



505
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,399
in addition to iron q another key player

506
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,399



507
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,360
is

508
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:23,360



509
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,600
honeywell who in june 2020 announced

510
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,600



511
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,880
that it had used trapped iron technology

512
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,880



513
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,760
to create the world's highest

514
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,760



515
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,720
performance quantum computer

516
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,720



517
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,120
clearly others may take a different view

518
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,120



519
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,200
but

520
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,200



521
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,959
regardless this is another important

522
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,959



523
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,080
development particularly

524
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:40,080



525
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,240
as honeywell reports that jpmorgan chase

526
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,240



527
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,480
is already experimenting with its system

528
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,480



529
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,200
to develop quantum financial services

530
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,200



531
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,839
software

532
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,839



533
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,839
including fraud detection and ai trading

534
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:51,839



535
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,839
applications

536
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:54,870



537
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,080
always when i make a video about quantum

538
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,080



539
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,160
computing

540
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,160



541
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,399
i get questions about how quantum

542
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,399



543
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,399
computers are programmed

544
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:04,399



545
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,720
at present this takes place using a

546
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:06,720



547
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,000
classical computer as a control device

548
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:10,000



549
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,000
with the languages used including python

550
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,000



551
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,079
an explanation of exactly what is

552
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,079



553
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,600
involved is well beyond the scope of

554
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:15,600



555
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,440
this video

556
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,440



557
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,640
but if you want to learn more and

558
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,640



559
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,360
actually experiment

560
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,360



561
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,240
go to the ibm quantum computing website

562
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,240



563
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,920
and click on

564
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,920



565
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,760
for developers next select try kiskit

566
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,760



567
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,839
which will allow you to experiment with

568
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,839



569
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,040
this open source development

570
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:33,040



571
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,200
environment one great

572
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,200



573
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,279
but still quite complex example shows

574
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,279



575
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,079
how it is possible to estimate the value

576
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:38,079



577
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,240
of pi

578
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:40,240



579
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,760
using a quantum phase estimation

580
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,760



581
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,720
algorithm

582
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,720



583
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,480
as you can see the python code begins by

584
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,480



585
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,480
importing relevant libraries

586
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,480



587
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,240
before progressing using commands that

588
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,240



589
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,399
will be pretty familiar to those with

590
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,399



591
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,959
some programming background

592
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:54,959



593
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,120
absolutely this is complex and something

594
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:57,120



595
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,440
you need to get your head around

596
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,440



597
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,360
but what i hope it makes clear is that

598
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,360



599
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,440
quantum computing is not quite so

600
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,440



601
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,640
removed from traditional computing as

602
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,640



603
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,640
many people believe

604
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:10,949



605
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,079
quantum computing is yet to become a

606
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,079



607
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,200
commercial

608
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:17,200



609
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,839
reality this said as we've seen in this

610
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,839



611
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,000
video

612
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:20,000



613
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,040
significant progress continues to be

614
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,040



615
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,680
made and

616
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,680



617
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,600
i remain confident that some kind of

618
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,600



619
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,399
quantum hardware will find useful

620
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,399



621
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,320
application

622
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:30,320



623
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:32,959
in the second half of this decade

624
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,959



625
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,600
but now that's it for another video if

626
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:33,600



627
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,839
